A Plugin that uses the power of Artificial Intelligence to automatically generate post tags.

== Description ==
This plugin generates tags using your post content. The post content is sent via an API that process it using advanced machine learning models and outputs a list of tags relevant to the content. No data is stored on the api and after processing the content it is removed from memory. No other information is sent or saved on the API server.

Designed to be simple to use, it only requires activation and you are all set. Existing tags will not be overwritten.
Can be turned on or off for individual posts.
Go to ADMIN -> Posts -> AI Auto Tagger to automatically tag all existing posts.
